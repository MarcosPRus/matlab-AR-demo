# matlab-AR-demo
Matlab program that generates a 3D structure on top of a pattern printed on a piece of paper

To use it you will need to calibrate your webcam. You can do this using the Matlab app. You will also need the image processing add-on.
After that name your calibration file "Calib_Results.mat" and run the main.m program.
